# Adaptive Practice Mode – Accessibility

## Predictability

- Adaptive changes must not feel random or punitive.

## Screen Readers

- Practice mode should be announced distinctly from timed modes.

## Implementation Notes

- Maintain consistent interaction patterns with core gameplay for familiarity.
