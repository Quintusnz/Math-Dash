# Adaptive Practice Mode – Overview

## Overview

Adaptive Practice Mode adjusts question difficulty and topic emphasis within a session based on how the child is performing, while keeping the experience simple and non-intimidating.

## Primary User Goals

- Children get questions that are not too easy and not too hard.
- Parents feel confident that practice time is targeted and effective.

## Success Criteria

- Difficulty ramps within clear bounds; no sudden jumps.
- Explanations stay behind the scenes; UI remains simple.

## Related Documentation

- `requirements2.md` §3.6 Adaptive Practice.
- `Docs/user-flows.md` (practice loop).
