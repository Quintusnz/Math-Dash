# Player Profiles & Avatars – Overview

## Overview

This feature defines how households create and manage separate child profiles, each with their own progress, preferences, and avatar.

## Primary User Goals

- Parents can easily add and manage multiple children on one device.
- Children can recognize and select their own profile using avatar and name.
- Sensitive controls remain behind a simple adult gate.

## Success Criteria

- Profile list clearly shows name, avatar, and key progress summary.
- Adding a profile is a short, guided flow.
- Children cannot accidentally edit or delete profiles.

## Related Documentation

- `requirements2.md` §3.1 and §3.4.
- `Docs/user-flows.md` (onboarding, switching child).
- `design-documentation/design-system/components.md` (profile picker, avatar grid).
