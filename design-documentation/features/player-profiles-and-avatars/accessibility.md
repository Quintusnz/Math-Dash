# Player Profiles & Avatars – Accessibility

## Visual Design

- Avatars must be distinguishable beyond color alone (shapes, accessories).
- Profile cards should maintain good contrast and clear focus states.

## Labels & Screen Readers

- Profile cards announce child name and key summary (e.g., “Ava, aged 8”).

## Input & Focus

- All fields and avatar options reachable with keyboard.
- Focus order follows visual layout.

## Implementation Notes

- Reuse global form and selection patterns.
