# Game Modes – Overview

## Overview

Game Modes defines how rounds are configured: timed (30s/60s), fixed question counts (10/20), and untimed practice. Modes change pacing and expectations but reuse the same core gameplay loop.

## Primary User Goals

- Children can choose how they want to be challenged without being overwhelmed.
- Parents/teachers understand what each mode means and when to use it.

## Success Criteria

- At most three primary mode choices visible at once.
- Mode descriptions short and understandable by children.
- Summary clearly indicates which mode was used.

## Related Documentation

- `requirements2.md` §3.3 Feature 3 – Game Modes.
- `design-documentation/design-system/components.md` (Pre-Game configuration, Game Session, Summary).
