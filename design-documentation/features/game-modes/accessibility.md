# Game Modes – Accessibility

## Visual Clarity

- Mode buttons must have clear labels and sufficient contrast.
- Timer and counters should be easy to read at a glance.

## Input & Focus

- Mode options focusable in logical order; selection state obvious in focus visuals.

## Screen Readers

- Include mode name and description (e.g., “60-second timed round”) in accessible labels.

## Implementation Notes

- Ensure that users who cannot perceive the timer visually still get enough context via text and assistive technologies.
