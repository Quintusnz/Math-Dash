# Monetization & Access Control – Accessibility

## Clarity

- Lock icons and text must be understandable, with sufficient contrast.

## Screen Readers

- Locked items announce as locked and for grown-ups.

## Implementation Notes

- Ensure that upgrade dialogs are fully keyboard-navigable and screen-reader friendly.
