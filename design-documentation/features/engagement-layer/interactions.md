# Engagement Layer – Interactions

## Reward Reveals

- Post-round, celebrate new achievements with a short animation and clear `Continue` action.

## Streaks

- Streak indicators update live but do not interrupt play.

## Implementation Notes

- Respect reduced-motion settings; offer toned-down alternatives.
