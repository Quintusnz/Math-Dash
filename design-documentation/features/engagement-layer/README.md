# Engagement Layer – Overview

## Overview

The Engagement Layer adds light gamification (streaks, stars, badges) to keep children motivated without overwhelming them.

## Primary User Goals

- Children feel rewarded for consistent effort, not just high scores.
- Parents see simple indicators of consistency.

## Success Criteria

- Rewards reinforce healthy habits and do not pressure.
- Visuals are fun but not distracting during gameplay.

## Related Documentation

- `requirements2.md` §3.7 Engagement.
- `Docs/user-flows.md` (achievement reveal moments).
- `design-documentation/design-system/components.md` (badge strip, streak indicators).
