# Math Dash Style Guide

## Design Philosophy
Math Dash is **Bold, Playful, and Focused**.
- **Bold Simplicity**: Large touch targets, clear hierarchy, no clutter.
- **Playful Energy**: Bright colors, rounded shapes, bouncy animations.
- **Focused Learning**: When the timer starts, distractions fade away.

## 1. Color System
*Reference: [Color Tokens](./tokens/colors.md)*

Our palette is built on a foundation of **Joyful Primaries** supported by **Calm Neutrals**.
- **Primary**: Blue-Violet (Brand & Action)
- **Secondary**: Fresh Teal (Supportive & Friendly)
- **Accents**: Gold, Coral, Sky (Energy & Rewards)
- **Neutral**: Cool Grays (Structure & Text)
- **Semantic**: Green (Success), Amber (Warning), Red (Error), Blue (Info)

## 2. Typography
*Reference: [Typography System](./tokens/typography.md)*

We use **Nunito** for headings to feel friendly and approachable, and **Inter** for body text to ensure maximum legibility.
- **Headings**: Rounded, Bold, Tight tracking.
- **Body**: Clean, Open, Tall x-height.

## 3. Spacing & Layout
*Reference: [Spacing System](./tokens/spacing.md)*

We use an **8px Grid**.
- **Micro**: 4px / 8px
- **Macro**: 16px / 24px / 32px
- **Layout**: Centered containers with generous whitespace.

## 4. Components
*Reference: [Component Library](./components/README.md)*

Our components are designed for **Touch First**.
- **Buttons**: Pill-shaped, elevated, tactile.
- **Cards**: White rounded surfaces with soft shadows.
- **Inputs**: Large text size (16px+) to prevent zooming.

## 5. Motion
*Reference: [Animation Tokens](./tokens/animations.md)*

Motion is used to provide **Feedback** and **Delight**.
- **Transitions**: Snappy (200-300ms).
- **Feedback**: Bouncy (Spring physics) for success states.
- **Reduced Motion**: Always respected.

## 6. Accessibility
*Reference: [Accessibility Guidelines](../accessibility/guidelines.md)*

Accessibility is not an afterthought.
- **Contrast**: AA Standard.
- **Target Size**: 44px minimum.
- **Screen Readers**: Full support.

## 7. Platform
*Reference: [Web Guidelines](./platform-adaptations/web.md)*

Ready Steady Math is a **Web-First** application.
- **Responsive**: Adapts to Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop.
- **PWA**: Installable and offline-capable.
- **Browser**: Respects browser navigation and history.
