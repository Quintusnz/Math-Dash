## Curriculum Source References (Draft)

Reference set for aligning Ready Steady Math benchmarks and age/year mappings. URLs are for traceability; always check the latest official publications.

### New Zealand (NZ)
- Source: The New Zealand Curriculum: Mathematics and Statistics (Years 1–8) – https://nzcurriculum.tki.org.nz
- Alignment: Number facts and place-value progressions through Level 4 map to core fluency (bonds to 20, add/sub within 100/1000, times tables to 10 by Y4, division inverses). 12×12 treated as enrichment (extension) for Y5–Y8.
- Simplifications: Written vs mental method distinctions are harmonized into fluency skills; multiplicative reasoning strands condensed into times-table/division fluency.

### Australia (AU)
- Source: Australian Curriculum: Mathematics v9.0 (Foundation–Year 6) – https://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au
- Alignment: Fluency strand expects bonds to 20 by Y2, add/sub within 100 by Y2–Y3, and multiplicative thinking (2, 3, 5, 10 tables) by Y3; full 10×10 fluency by Y4–Y5. We place 12×12 as extension for upper primary.
- Simplifications: Uses “Foundation” label for F; harmonizes number-fact fluency across states.

### United Kingdom (England) (UK)
- Source: National Curriculum in England: Mathematics Programmes of Study (KS1–KS2, 2014) – https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study
- Alignment: Expect fluent recall of multiplication/division facts to 12×12 by end of Y4; bonds to 20 and add/sub within 100 in KS1; add/sub within 1000 and written methods in lower KS2. Our core maps 12×12 to Y4 and keeps it core through Y6.
- Simplifications: KS1/KS2 strand wording collapsed into skill IDs for fact fluency; geometry/measurement omitted.

### United States (US)
- Source: Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM), Grades K–5 – http://www.corestandards.org/Math
- Alignment: Fluency targets: K.OA.A.5 (add/sub within 5), 1.OA.C.6 (within 10/20), 2.OA.B.2 (within 20), 3.OA.C.7 (multiplication/division within 10). We keep 12×12 as enrichment/extension (not core) for G4–G5 to support mixed-table gameplay.
- Simplifications: State-specific pacing not modeled; uses national CCSS baseline.

### Canada (Ontario) (CA)
- Source: Ontario Mathematics Curriculum (revised 2020), Grades 1–6 – https://www.dcp.edu.gov.on.ca/en/curriculum/elementary-mathematics
- Alignment: Strand B (Number) calls for addition/subtraction fluency within 20 by G2, within 100/1000 by G3–G4, and multiplication/division facts within 10 by G4. Exposure to 12s is treated as enrichment in G5–G6.
- Simplifications: Uses Ontario as representative baseline; provincial variation not modeled.

### Supplementary cross-check (practice sites)
- IXL NZ/AU/CA country sites (e.g., https://nz.ixl.com/math, https://au.ixl.com/maths, https://ca.ixl.com/math) used to sanity-check fact fluency placement and age/year labels. These inform extension (enrichment) placement for 12×12 in North America.

### Age/Year Mapping Notes
- Age bands (5–6 through 12–13) map to year/grade options in `country-config.ts` and match typical starting ages in the referenced curricula (e.g., AU Foundation ≈ 5–6, US Kindergarten ≈ 5–6, UK Year 6 ≈ 10–11).
- Cut-off month differences are not modeled; mappings represent the most common placement for learners starting in the first half of the school year.

### Known Simplifications / Pending Expert Review
- Geometry/measurement/fractions standards are out of scope; we focus on number fact fluency and operations.
- Written-method vs mental-method distinctions are consolidated into fluency skills.
- 12×12 is core in UK (per NC expectation) and extension in AU/NZ/US/CA.
- A curriculum specialist review is still recommended to validate wording and sequencing; schedule when available.
