# Curriculum Tracking Help for Families

This page answers the most common questions parents and grown-ups ask about the Curriculum Alignment & Progress Tracking feature. It also highlights the quick actions and accessibility cues that live inside the app.

## Getting started with the curriculum view

1. The **Grown-Ups** tab shows each child’s curriculum progress card. Tap **Set curriculum** to open the country/year picker.  
2. Choose a country (or skip if you prefer not to set a curriculum yet), then select the current year/grade your child is attending.  
3. The selector will recommend a level based on the child’s age band, but you can always override it if your child is held back, accelerated, or if their school placement differs from the age-based suggestion.

## Frequently asked questions

### What is curriculum tracking?
Curriculum tracking compares a child’s mastered and developing facts against the benchmark skills described in the national curricula for NZ, AU, UK, US, and CA. The feature groups skills into **core** (what should be in focus this year) and **extension** (stretch goals), shows proficiency levels, and surfaces next-best-practice recommendations.

### How do I set my child’s year level?
After selecting their country, the year/grade picker automatically highlights the year that matches the child’s selected age band. If you know your child is still in Year 2 (or Grade 1) despite being 7 years old, tap the Year/Grade option so the system uses that explicit selection for progress tracking going forward. The curriculum card will continue to show the derived suggestion as a “Recommended” label, plus a short hint reminding you that it is adjustable.

### What does “On Track” mean?
“On Track” means more than half of the child’s **core** skills are at the **proficient** or **mastered** level. If most core skills are still developing or not started, the status will display **Behind**. When 80%+ of core skills are mastered and extensions have been touched, the status flips to **Ahead**. Use the status badge and the skill list to understand how the overall summary maps to specific domains.

### My child is showing “Needs Focus” — what should we do?
“Needs Focus” (in the app you will see developing/not-started badges) is an invitation to open the **Recommended focus** list and start a practice session. Tap any recommendation to launch the matching game configuration, and focus on accuracy before speed. As progress builds, the badge will update automatically. You can also bookmark or practice individual skills from the skill breakdown section downstream of the progress card.

### Which countries are supported?
- 🇳🇿 **New Zealand**  
- 🇦🇺 **Australia**  
- 🇬🇧 **United Kingdom (England)**  
- 🇺🇸 **United States**  
- 🇨🇦 **Canada (Ontario)**  
The curriculum data includes year/grade benchmarks and skill mappings for each country, and we will expand support as more curricula are added.

### How accurate is this compared to school assessments?
Curriculum tracking runs on the same practice data captured inside Math Dash. It is **not an official school assessment**, but it reflects the child’s in-app performance against the curriculum definitions we have researched. The overall status and skill breakdown are best-effort reflections computed from mastered facts, accuracy, coverage, and response time. Always share results with teachers as conversation starters rather than formal diagnostics.

## Parent guide: understanding curriculum progress

- **Review the overall status badge** to see whether the child is ahead, on track, or behind.  
- **Inspect core vs. extension skill rows** to identify specific gaps (e.g., times tables, doubles, division).  
- **Use the recommended focus actions** to immediately start a practice session from the curriculum card. These actions pre-configure the right topic type and skill domain.  
- **Revisit the selector** if your child changes school placement, curriculum, or grade level—saving a new year/grade resets the benchmark and recalculates progress.

## In-app help & accessibility

- Every curriculum panel includes tooltip text (hover or focus the info icon) that reiterates what each badge means and how to adjust the year/grade.  
- The Year/Grade selector is built with keyboard focus management, high-contrast tokens, and touch-friendly buttons so the flow remains accessible (see `design-documentation/accessibility/guidelines.md`).  
- All recommendations and status indicators expose text alternatives so screen readers announce the skill label, proficiency, and recommended action.

If you still have questions, tap the **Help & support** icon inside the grown-ups tab to open live chat or send feedback through the in-app contact form.
