Here’s a full color system for Math Dash that’s playful for kids, modern for the product, and not a clone of Hit the Button / Twinkl.
I’ll give you:
1. Concept & vibe
2. Core palette (with hexes + usage)
3. Semantic colors
4. Neutral scale
5. Practical usage notes (for gameplay vs grown-up areas)

1. Concept & Vibe
Design goals for the palette:
* Feels fun and energetic for 6–11 year olds, without looking babyish.
* Works in a clean, minimal UI with big buttons and lots of whitespace.
* Strong enough contrast for quick recognition under time pressure.
* Clear semantic signals (correct/wrong/locked) for rapid feedback.
* Distinct from common “primary school” rainbow palettes by having:
o A cool, modern primary (blue-violet)
o A friendly teal secondary
o Warm, candy-like accents (gold + coral) used sparingly.
Think: “modern kids arcade + learning dashboard” rather than cartoon classroom.

2. Primary & Secondary System
Primary Colors (Brand / CTAs / Headers)
* Primary 500 (Main brand & CTAs)
#3056D3 – A rich, energetic blue-violet.
o Use for: Primary buttons, key highlights in the game UI, main nav selection, logo base.
* Primary Dark (600) (Hover / pressed / emphasis)
#2338A0
o Use for: Button hover/active states, focused borders, high-emphasis text on light cards.
* Primary Light (100) (Soft backgrounds)
#E0E7FF
o Use for: Panels behind scoreboards, subtle section backgrounds, progress dashboard tiles.
* Primary Ultra-Light (50)
#F3F6FF
o Use for: Page background tints in “Play” area, hover backgrounds on list rows.
Secondary Colors (Supportive, friendly)
* Secondary 500
#1FB8A6 – Fresh teal that pairs well with the primary.
o Use for: Secondary buttons, toggles, tags (e.g., mode chips), “Practice mode” emphasis.
* Secondary Light (100)
#D2F5F1
o Use for: Backgrounds for topic cards, avatar halos, “Adaptive mode” highlights.
* Secondary Pale (50)
#F0FBFA
o Use for: Large background washes in kids’ screens, banners, progress hints.

3. Accent Colors (Energy, Rewards, Highlights)
Used sparingly to keep the interface clean and avoid visual overload.
* Accent Primary – Gold Burst
#FFB224
o Use for: Stars, trophies, streak counters, “New high score” ribbons, progress bars.
* Accent Secondary – Coral Pop
#FF5A7A
o Use for: Achievements, small notification dots, limited-time challenges, badge details.
* Accent Cool – Sky
#38BDF8
o Use for: Info highlights, secondary progress indicators, hover outlines on “Skill Radar” cells.
* Gradient Pair (for Math Dash identity)
o Gradient Start: #3056D3 (Primary 500)
o Gradient End: #FF5A7A (Accent Coral)
o Use for: Hero banners, “Start Dash” button in marketing / onboarding, loading splash.
This blue ? coral gradient reads as “motion / dash / energy” without copying existing competitors’ strong yellow/green schemes.

4. Semantic Colors (Clear feedback under time pressure)
These should be instantly readable for kids, especially in a 60s dash round.
* Success
#16A34A (Strong green)
o Use for: Correct answer flash, success toasts, “Mastered” skill state.
* Warning
#FACC15 (Warm amber)
o Use for: Low time warnings, mild alerts (e.g., “Almost there”, streak expiring soon).
* Error
#DC2626 (Clear red)
o Use for: Wrong answer flash, destructive actions (delete profile), connection errors.
* Info
#0EA5E9
o Use for: Helper hints, tooltips in grown-up/teacher area, info banners.
Note: For kids, keep semantic usage very consistent:
* Green = “you did it”
* Red = “that one’s not right”
* Amber = “pay attention”
* Blue = “extra info / help”

5. Neutral Palette (UI structure & calm)
Neutrals should keep the UI breathable and let colors do targeted work.
* Neutral 50 #F9FAFB – App background (esp. teacher/parent dashboards)
* Neutral 100 #F3F4F6 – Card backgrounds, table rows
* Neutral 200 #E5E7EB – Borders, separators
* Neutral 300 #D1D5DB – Muted icons, disabled border
* Neutral 400 #9CA3AF – Secondary text (timestamps, helper copy)
* Neutral 500 #6B7280 – Body text on light backgrounds
* Neutral 700 #374151 – High-emphasis headings on light backgrounds
* Neutral 900 #111827 – Rare; logo wordmark, strongest headings if needed
These are intentionally “grown-up clean” so that:
* Play screens can lean more on Primary/Secondary + accents.
* Grown-ups/Teacher Area feels more like a modern dashboard with fewer saturated blocks.

6. Accessibility & Contrast Notes
* Primary 500 (#3056D3) on Neutral 50/100 easily hits WCAG AA for normal text and icons.
* Buttons:
o White text on Primary 500, Secondary 500, Accent Coral 500 all pass AA for normal-sized text.
* Error/Success:
o White on Error (#DC2626) and Success (#16A34A) are both AA-compliant for standard button text.
* Avoid using Accent Gold (#FFB224) as a text-on-white color; keep it for icons, fills, and badges.
* Ensure focus rings and outlines use either Primary Dark or a high-contrast neutral (e.g., Neutral 900 with opacity) to stay visible for keyboard users.

7. Practical Usage by Area
Kids “Play” Area
* Background: Neutral 50 or Primary Light 50 (#F3F6FF)
* Question panel: White or Neutral 50 with Primary 500 headline text.
* Answer buttons:
o Default: White background, border #E5E7EB, text Neutral 700.
o Hover / pressed: Fill Primary Light 100 / Secondary Light 100.
o Correct: Flash fill Success with a subtle glow.
o Wrong: Flash fill Error briefly, then highlight the correct button in Success green.
* Timer bar: Uses Accent Gold for remaining time, shifting toward Warning amber when nearly out.
* Streak counter, achievements: Use Accent Gold + Coral sparingly to avoid permanent visual noise.
Topics & Skill Library
* Topic tiles:
o Times Tables: Primary 500 with icon on Primary Light 100 circle.
o Division: Secondary 500
o Number Bonds: Accent Sky #38BDF8
o Doubles / Halves: Mix of Accent Gold and **Secondary 500`
* Locked topics: Desaturate + use Neutral 200 overlay and a subtle lock icon; keep text legible but clearly unavailable.
Progress Dashboard (“Skill Radar”)
* Background: Neutral 50
* Skill cells:
o Base cell: Neutral 100
o Low mastery: Tint with Secondary Pale 50
o Medium mastery: Primary Light 100
o High mastery: Primary 500 or Success green, with white text.
* Achievements & trophies: Primary use Accent Gold, with Accent Coral for rare/“epic” badges.
Grown-Ups / Teacher Area
* Overall: Much more neutral-heavy to signal a different mental mode.
* Background: Neutral 50
* Cards & panels: White / Neutral 100 with Primary 500 headings and minimal accents.
* Charts:
o Lines/bars: Primary 500, Secondary 500, Accent Sky for contrasts.
o Avoid heavy use of gold/coral here to keep it professional and readable.
