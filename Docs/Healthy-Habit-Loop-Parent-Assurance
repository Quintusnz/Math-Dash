At Math Dash, your child’s wellbeing comes first. That’s why we’ve designed our **Healthy Habit Loop** – short, focused practice sessions (about 5–10 minutes) that build strong number fact fluency without encouraging endless screen time. We avoid manipulative “dark patterns” like gambling-style rewards or harsh streak penalties, and instead focus on positive progress, gentle routines, and clear stopping points. Every engagement feature is intentionally designed to support healthy digital habits, so your child can grow in confidence and skill in a safe, balanced way.
