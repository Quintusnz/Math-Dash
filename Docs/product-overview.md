# Ready Steady Math – Product Overview

> **Note:** Ready Steady Math was previously referred to as 'Math Dash' in earlier internal drafts.

## 1. What Is Ready Steady Math?

Ready Steady Math is a fast, fun, browser-based math fluency game for children aged 6–11. Players race the clock (or complete fixed sets of questions) to answer single-step number fact questions (times tables, number bonds, doubles/halves, etc.) with quick taps on large, kid‑friendly answer buttons.

The experience is designed to be:

- Web‑first and cross‑device (Chromebooks, tablets, laptops).
- Simple enough for independent use by children.
- Informative enough for adults (parents and teachers) to see clear progress.

## 2. Who It’s For

- **Children (6–11)**  
  - Primary school years 1–6 / KS1–KS2.  
  - Using tablets, Chromebooks, family laptops, or shared classroom devices.
- **Parents / Caregivers (30–55)**  
  - Want short, effective daily practice (5–10 minutes).  
  - Need to understand where their child is strong/weak without complex dashboards.
- **Primary Teachers**  
  - Need low‑friction math warm‑ups and quick daily/weekly fluency practice.  
  - Want per‑pupil summaries and simple class‑level views (post‑MVP).

## 3. The Core Problem

Children need automatic recall of number facts to succeed in later math. Existing products:

- Drill facts but can feel repetitive or babyish.
- Often lack adaptivity per child.
- Hide or complicate progress insights for adults.
- Don't always respect classroom realities (shared devices, mixed ages, limited time).

Ready Steady Math aims to solve these by:

- Providing short, high‑tempo rounds kids enjoy.
- Automatically tuning difficulty (post‑MVP adaptive mode).
- Surfacing a clear “skill radar” view per child.
- Being deliberately simple to deploy in multi‑child homes and classrooms.

## 4. Unique Value Proposition

- **Adaptive practice** (per‑child, heuristic‑based in phase one).
- **Skill Radar dashboard** with clear proficiency bands per topic.
- **Lightweight engagement** (streaks, goals, achievements) without over‑gamification.
- **Web‑first, cross‑device** implementation ideal for Chromebooks and low‑friction home use.
- **Designed for multi‑child and classroom use** from day one.
- **Freemium, low‑price core upgrade** with optional, credit‑based AI add‑ons.

## 5. Success Metrics

Primary indicators for product/market fit:

- ≥ 60% of active children play 3+ days/week after 4 weeks.
- Median correct answers in a 60‑second round improves by ≥ 30% after 6 weeks of typical use.
- NPS ≥ 40 from parent and teacher surveys.
- ≥ 5% free‑to‑paid conversion in first 3 months for a mature cohort.
- ≥ 50 active classrooms (weekly use) in year one.
